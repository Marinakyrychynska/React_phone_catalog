REACT PHONE CATALOG

I made the website. The site has four pages (Home, Phones, Tablets, Asseccories),
search field, Favorites page and Card page. 
During development, I use:
  - SASS preprocessor;
  - BEM methodology;
  - used flex to place elements;
  - used transition for smooth increase of icons and pictures as links on hover
I made sliders for products and pagination.
I added Router to the React application. Used the navigation for the Header block using NavLink.
Also used such hooks as useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useContext.
Also used custom hook to create a repository for LocalStorage on the Card and Favorite page.
Every Components created using a functional component.
I used SearchParams for filtering and searching products.
Also used were such libraries as classNames, lodash.debounse, react-router-dom.
Use such method for working with arrays (sort, filter, map).

The mockup and demo are below.
